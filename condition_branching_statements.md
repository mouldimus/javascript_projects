# Conditional and Branching Statements

Both are used to control the flow of a program.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to execute code based on a condition.

```js
let age = 17;
let statement = age > 18;
```

## Branching Instructions

Branching statements are directions to execute 2 or more blocks of code.

```js
if (statement) {
    // execute program path 1
} else {
    // execute program path 2
}
```
